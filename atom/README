                 ATOM
=========================================


Ab initio calculations for a single atom

Features:
_ Hartree-Fock
_ LDA
_ HF+GW
_ LDA+GW
_ QPscGW
_ HF+MP2
_ QSscMP2
_ CI for 2 electrons 


Installation:
libint is required:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libint/files/libint-for-beginners/libint-2.0.0-prealpha.tgz/download
libxc is required:
http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/down.php?file=libxc/libxc-1.0.tar.gz
Atom needs fortran, c and c++ compilers

Basis sets:
Basis sets can be obtained from https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal
The file can be generated from a NWChem file using the script
./util/basis_nwchem2atom.py B_aug-cc-pVDZ.nwchem


Usage:
The basis file needs to be located in the working directory.
./atom < helium.in > helium.out

Sample input files can be found in ./tests/


To be done:
* implement GGA : need the gradient of a gaussian
* symmetrize the Coulomb integrals to save memory with a factor 8 (not really a good idea for MP2, GW etc.) (i'm not sure it is really interesting)

Future:
* molecules
* pure gaussians not only cartesian
* pseudopotentials (e.g. Goedecker flavor)

Issues:
* QPscGW scf loop is quite unstable for large basis sets, use a low alpha (<= 0.50)
