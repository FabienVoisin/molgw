_ HF+GW
_ DFT+GW
_ Hybrid+GW
_ QPscGW
_ HF+MP2
_ DFT+MP2

Installation:
libint is required:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libint/files/libint-for-beginners/libint-2.0.0-prealpha.tgz/download
libxc is required:
http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/down.php?file=libxc/libxc-1.2.0.tar.gz
Atom needs fortran, c and c++ compilers

Basis sets:
Basis sets can be obtained from https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal
The file can be generated from a NWChem file using the script
./util/basis_nwchem2molgw.py B_aug-cc-pVDZ.nwchem


Usage:
The basis file needs to be located in the working directory.
./molgw < helium.in > helium.out

Sample input files can be found in ./tests/


To be done:
* filter the vanishing gaussian integrals so to save memory
* use Schwarz inequality to avoid evaluating integrals

Future:
* pure gaussians not only cartesian
* pseudopotentials (e.g. ECP or Goedecker flavor)

Issues:
* QPscGW scf loop is quite unstable for large basis sets, use a low alpha (<= 0.50)
